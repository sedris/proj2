========================

###Heroku URL

Please put it here: http://calm-taiga-1727.herokuapp.com

###Notes

Users must be logged into the site in order to view it, and are redirected to the sign up page if they try to go to pages on the site. Users 'shopper' and 'shopkeeper' are my test accounts, and both have a password of 'test'. 'shopper' currently has one order from 'shopkeeper's items. Items can be added to 'shopkeeper' by logging into the account and selecting 'Your Items', and items can be purchased by 'shopper' by logging into the account and selecting 'shopkeeper's store from the home page. Items can be removed from the cart by going to the cart page, or on the respective item's store page. Items can be saved from a shopkeeper's items page, and carts can be saved from a user's cart page. Saved items and carts can be viewed through the 'saved' page, and either directly checked out or added to the cart. To checkout and create an order, select 'Checkout' from the cart page, and go to the orders page to view all past orders.
